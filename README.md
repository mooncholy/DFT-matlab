# DFT-matlab
A MATLAB code to perform Discrete Fourier Transform
## Features
1. Input signal can be a discrete form of a continuous signal (sine, cosine, ramp, exponential)
2. Input signal can be an array of discrete values entered by user
3. The code plots the waveform of the continuous and discrete signals in time domain and the spectrum of DFT w.r.t magnitue and phase.
